# Cyclone_Intensity_Prediction
## Introduction:
Natural disasters are unpredictable as a result of ongoing climate change. According to a
special study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global warming
of more than two degrees Celsius increases the frequency of heavy rainfall and decreases
the frequency of tropical cyclones (TCs), but increases the frequency of intense TCs. It is
difficult for people to plan for natural catastrophes like TCs, which severely damage
infrastructure and do great harm to people. A behavioral shift in TCs could directly
increase the economic harm they cause, from $28 billion in 2010 to $68 billion by 2100,
according to the World Bank's 2012 annual report. The NHC forecasts tropical
cyclone intensity, magnitude, and structure as well as rainfall, tropical cyclones
associated with hurricanes, and the likelihood of tropical cyclones within 48 hours
## Problem Statement:
INSAT-3D, a satellite owned by India, is stationed over the Indian Ocean. Every year, a large
number of households lose their houses as a result of inaccurate cyclone strength predictions.
ISRO wants to forecast the severity of upcoming cyclones. To achieve the prediction, an image
captured by the INSAT-3D satellite will be used with two software tools named deep CNN and
AlexNET. The knowledge gained from this can be applied to lessen the cyclone's harm.
AlexNET is a predetermined method for analyzing images. It enables you to identify what's in a
photo or arrange photos according to specific criteria. Pictures of cyclones will be used to make
predictions that can help the government.
